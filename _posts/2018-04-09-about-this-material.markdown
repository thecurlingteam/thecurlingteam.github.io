The documents presented in the following posts are not a textbook. They are a simple and hopefully humble collection of notes. They contain all the flavours that are not loved during the creation of textbooks, being purposedly not concise, showing all the kinds of highlights and colors that violate the conventions of good typography.

There is a silent agreement between some textbook writers: in order to avoid redundance, or to simply compete with other authors, they often cut off some important details. The final result is actually a *good* one, but only those who already know the whole subject can actually appreciate it. They can compare what is written in the textbook with their background, enjoying the quicker sentences, the smarter substitutions, or the untold steps. 

In the Prologue to [*Silvanus Thompson*, **Calculus Made Easy**](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33283) (Second Edition, MacMillan and Co., Limited St. Martin's Street, London 1914), the author states:

> They seem to desire to impress you with their tremendous cleverness by going about it in the most difficult way.

With the intention to achieve such a conciseness and fluency *at any cost*, the risk is to leave the newcomers out of the conversation. If textbooks are supposed to be the primary source for them, this is a harmful process.

The notes presented here are for those who do not know *at all* the subjects of the posts: those who, for the first time, approach to them.

Some other texts or lecture notes are not rigorous: for example, they obtain right results with wrong steps. Steps are important as much; every time it is possible, they are shown by the Curling Team.
