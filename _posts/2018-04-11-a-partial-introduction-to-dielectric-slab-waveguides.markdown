The simplest type of dielectric waveguide is composed by a slab with an infinite extension: it is the dielectric conceptual equivalent of the parallel plate metallic waveguide.

An introduction to the structure and the features of such waveguides is presented here. This is *partial*, because it could be updated and expanded, and it does not thoroughly deal with all the aspects of this problem.

The document tries to adopt a systematic approach towards the Maxwell equation solution, to determine the available field configurations that can carry a signal along a single direction, inside the dielectric structure. An attempt to mention also the preliminary concepts is made, like the oblique incidence of a wave on a surface and the Second order differential equations.
